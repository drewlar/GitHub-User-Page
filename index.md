## Bio

Hello my name is Andrew Lara, I also go by "Drew", it makes my name shorter and friendly. I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year Mathematics-Computer Science Undergradute at UC San Diego. 

I am from a small border town in Imperial County CA called Calexico. If you know where that is congrats, not a lot of people do! I lived there my whole life, going to school for the most part in the neigboring city El Centro. My parents on the other hand were born in Mexico and grew up there, so I am Mexican. I would like to say I grew up in a household of women since I have two older sisters that stayed home alongside my mother while my dad went to work. Both of my sisters are married and have children, so I am an uncle, and to be exact I am an uncle of **7 nephews and nieces**! ~~Imagine the mess when all of us are in one household~~

## Coding Journey

I didn't offically start writing code until my last year of High School. The year before I took a intro to computer science where I did block coding, but that was all the experience I had before coming to UC San Diego. I had always thought I would become a Mathematican or an Architect when I was little, but I quickly fell in love with Computer Science in high school. I was still set on improving my math skills while learning about computer science, so I ended up choosing the Mathematics-Computer Science major here at UC San Diego. 

In such a highly competitive field, sometimes it is nice to look back and see where we all started. Just like a big portion of programmers out there, my first few lines of codes were,

```
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.print("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
I like to share this detail, because it was only through practice and learning that many coders get to the level that they are now, and I am no exception. In my journey I went through many failures and successes, both are good teachers. From all my experience in life so far I  like to tell people I talk to that...
>You shouldn't define yourself from your success but rather from your failures. Your true self is revealed when you encounter failure.
